          Our body is amazing! It is made up of many parts that work together to help us move, eat, breathe, and do everything we need. Letâ€™s learn about some of the important parts of the body.
        </p>
        <h3>1.1. Body Parts</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Head:</strong> The top part of our body. It holds our brain, eyes, ears, nose, and mouth.</li>
          <li><strong>Torso:</strong> The middle part of the body. It holds important organs like the heart, lungs, and stomach.</li>
          <li><strong>Arms and Legs:</strong> We use them to move, play, and do many activities.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>1.2. Important Systems</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>The Skeletal System:</strong> Our bones make up our skeleton. The skeleton helps us stand and protect our organs.</li>
          <li><strong>The Muscular System:</strong> Muscles help us move. When we want to walk or pick something up, our muscles work.</li>
          <li><strong>The Digestive System:</strong> This system helps us break down food and get energy. The stomach and intestines are important parts.</li>
          <li><strong>The Circulatory System:</strong> The heart pumps blood to carry oxygen and nutrients to all parts of the body.</li>

        </p>
        <h3>2.1. Healthy Eating</h3>
        <p className="section-text">

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fruits and Vegetables</li>
          <li>Proteins (like chicken or beans)</li>
          <li>Grains (like rice or bread)</li>
          <li>Dairy (like milk or cheese)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Activity: Make a Healthy Plate</h4>
