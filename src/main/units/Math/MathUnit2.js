        <p className="section-text">
          Measurement is a way of comparing the size, weight, or volume of objects. We use different units to measure different things. For example, we use meters to measure length, grams to measure weight, and liters to measure volume or capacity.
        </p>

        <h3>1.1. Types of Measurement</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Length:</strong> How long or short something is. Measured in meters (m), centimeters (cm), or millimeters (mm).</li>
          <li><strong>Weight (Mass):</strong> How heavy something is. Measured in grams (g) or kilograms (kg).</li>
          <li><strong>Capacity:</strong> How much space something can hold. Measured in liters (L) or milliliters (mL).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.2. Units of Measurement</h3>
        <p>We use standard units to measure things. Here are some examples:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Length:</strong> 1 meter (m) = 100 centimeters (cm)</li>
          <li><strong>Weight:</strong> 1 kilogram (kg) = 1000 grams (g)</li>
          <li><strong>Capacity:</strong> 1 liter (L) = 1000 milliliters (mL)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.6. Systems of Measurement</h3>
        <p>There are two types of measurement systems:</p>
        <ul>
          <li className="mb-3"><strong>Regular Measurement System:</strong> A regular system involves measuring things using standard units like centimeters, meters, milliliters, or liters. These systems are more consistent. For example, you might use a red, blue, or green tape measure to measure different objects in centimeters or meters. A standard unit of measurement ensures that measurements are universally understood and can be converted easily. Examples include the metric system (used globally) or the International System of Units (SI).</li>
          <li><strong>Irregular Measurement System:</strong> An irregular system uses objects or units that are not standardized. These units can vary depending on the object used for measurement. For example, you might measure the length of an object using a piece of string, your hand span, or the length of your foot. While these methods can provide a rough estimate, they are not precise and can vary from person to person or object to object. Examples include using a foot-length or a palm-width as units of measurement.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.7. Examples of Systems</h3>
        <p>Here are some practical examples of both regular and irregular measurement systems:</p>
        <ul>
          <li className="mb-3"><strong>Regular Measurement System Example:</strong> Using a meter stick or a tape measure to measure the length of a table in meters or centimeters. The measurement is precise and universally accepted.</li>
          <li><strong>Irregular Measurement System Example:</strong> Using a piece of string to measure the length of a table, and then comparing that string with your own foot length to estimate the table's size. The result will vary based on the personâ€™s foot size, making it less reliable.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Activity: Direct Comparison of Length</h4>
        <p>In direct comparison, you can compare two objects by physically placing them next to each other to see which is longer.</p>
        <p>Take two pencils and place them side by side to compare their lengths. Which one is longer?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Object 1 (Pencil A): __________</li>
          <li>Object 2 (Pencil B): __________</li>
          <li>Which pencil is longer? ___________</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Activity: Indirect Comparison of Length</h4>
        <p>In indirect comparison, you measure the objects using a ruler or tape measure to determine their lengths in centimeters or meters.</p>
        <p>Use a tape measure to measure the length of each pencil. Which one is longer based on the measurements?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Object 1 (Pencil A): __________ cm</li>
          <li>Object 2 (Pencil B): __________ cm</li>
          <li>Which pencil is longer based on the measurements? ___________</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Activity: Direct Comparison of Weight</h4>
        <p>In direct comparison, you estimate the weight of two objects by using your hands to feel and compare them.</p>
        <p>Pick up two objects (like a rock and a book) and try to estimate which one feels heavier by using your hands.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Object 1 (Rock): __________ (Feels heavier or lighter?)</li>
          <li>Object 2 (Book): __________ (Feels heavier or lighter?)</li>
          <li>Which object feels heavier? ___________</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Activity: Indirect Comparison of Weight</h4>
        <p>In indirect comparison, you would use a balance scale to measure the weight of the objects accurately in grams.</p>
        <p>Place each object (a rock and a book) on a balance scale with equal arms. Which object is heavier based on the scale reading?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Object 1 (Rock): __________ g</li>
          <li>Object 2 (Book): __________ g</li>
          <li>Which object is heavier based on the scale? ___________</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Activity: Direct Comparison of Capacity</h4>
        <p>In direct comparison, you compare the capacity of two containers by visually observing which holds more liquid.</p>
        <p>Take two containers of different sizes (one small and one large). Fill both with the same liquid and see which holds more. Can you tell just by looking?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Object 1 (Small container): __________ (Estimate the amount of liquid)</li>
          <li>Object 2 (Large container): __________ (Estimate the amount of liquid)</li>
          <li>Which container holds more liquid? ___________</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Activity: Indirect Comparison of Capacity</h4>
        <p>In indirect comparison, you use a graduated cylinder or measuring cup to measure the capacity of each container in milliliters or liters.</p>
        <p>Use a measuring cup to measure how much liquid each container holds. Which container holds more liquid?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Object 1 (Small container): __________ mL</li>
          <li>Object 2 (Large container): __________ mL</li>
          <li>Which container holds more liquid based on the measurements? ___________</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instruments Used</h3>
        <p>Here are some instruments used in measuring:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>For Length:</strong> Tape measure to measure in centimeters or millimeters.</li>
          <li><strong>For Weight:</strong> Equal-arm balance to compare the weight of two objects.</li>
          <li><strong>For Capacity:</strong> Graduated containers (such as measuring cups or measuring cylinders) to measure capacity.</li>
